            React is beautiful and efficient. One of the best features of it is <strong>the Hooks.</strong> I wanted to learn them better by using them, so I created this tiny website for my entertainment. This website includes simple use cases for each React hook. If you are a beginner to hooks, go ahead and play with it. <br/> <br/> The examples are understood best if you check the code also, so don't forget to get your hands dirty and mess up the code. <br/> <br/>
            Have fun!
